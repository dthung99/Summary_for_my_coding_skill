# Summary for my coding skill

This repository serves as a summary of my coding projects and implementations. It's designed to provide potential employers with an easy-to-navigate overview of my technical skills and experience.

## Python

- [Slicer extension for path planning for brain biospy](https://github.com/dthung99/Image_guided_Navigation_for_Robotics_MSc_course/blob/main/Needle_Path_planning/Needle_Path_Planning/Needle_Path_Planning.py)

- [Beta-VAE-WGAN for brain MRI images](https://github.com/dthung99/VAE_GAN_for_brain_MRI_images/blob/main/vae-gan-neonatal-mri.ipynb)

- [U-Net for liver tumor segmentation](https://github.com/dthung99/U_Net_for_liver_tumor_segmentation/blob/main/u-net-liver-segmentation.ipynb)

- [Random AI learning projects](https://github.com/dthung99/AI_small_project)

- [Haptic device (The links to important codes are given in the README.md)](https://github.com/dthung99/Advanced_Medical_Robotics_MSc_course)

## C++

- [Simulation of brain biospy in ROS](https://github.com/dthung99/Image_guided_Navigation_for_Robotics_MSc_course/blob/main/ROS_needle_insert_simulation_ws/src/needle_path_simulation/src/move_robot.cpp)

- [PID microcontroller](https://github.com/dthung99/Applied_Medical_Robotics_MSc_course/blob/main/Arduino/microcontroller/microcontroller.ino)

## MATLAB

- [Communication with the microcontroller and solving the kinematics (It is among my first coding projects, so the codes are really bad)](https://github.com/dthung99/Applied_Medical_Robotics_MSc_course/tree/main/MATLAB)

## Disclosure

100% of the codes are my implementation (or maybe 99%) with references to different onlin sources. The biggest credit should belong to my tutor: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), who has always been by my side during all the highs and lows.
